Description:: 
A single round of the forward AES-256 KeySchedule is performed.

// Within each element group, 
The next round key is generated word by word from the
previous round key element group in `vd` and the immediately previous word of the
round key. The least significant word of the next round key is generated by
applying a function to the most significant word of the current round key and
then XORing the result with the round constant.
The round number is used to select the round constant as well as the function.

The round number, which ranges from 2 to 14, comes from `uimm[3:0]`;
`uimm[4]` is ignored.
The out-of-range `uimm[3:0]` values of 0-1 and 15 are mapped to in-range
values by inverting `uimm[3]`. Thus, 0-1 maps to 8-9, and 15 maps to 7.

This instruction must always be implemented such that its execution latency does not depend
on the data being operated upon.

[NOTE]
====
We chose to map out-of-range round numbers to in-range values as this allows the instruction's
behavior to be fully defined for all values of `uimm[4:0]` with minimal extra logic. 
====

//

// The number of element groups to be processed is `vl`/`EGS`.
// `vl` must be set to the number of `SEW=32` elements to be processed and 
// therefore must be a multiple of `EGS=4`. + 
// Likewise, `vstart` must be a multiple of `EGS=4`.
